Absolutely HUGE layout for both apartments make this ideal for owner occupy buyers or a solid investment for the buyer looking to add a quality property to there portfolio.  1st floor has access to the finished basement that adds a ton of value to the property and possibly can be converted back to a 3 unit if desired and if approved by the city. 2nd floor flat is modern with a ton of charm.
